# 🚀 GitHub Setup Instructions

## Your project is now ready for GitHub! Here's what has been done:

### ✅ Security Measures Applied:
1. **.env file protection**: Your API keys are safe and won't be committed
2. **.gitignore created**: Prevents sensitive files from being uploaded  
3. **.env.example template**: Shows others what environment variables they need

### 📁 Project renamed: segmentation → chatbot

### 🔧 What to do next:

1. **Create GitHub repository:**
   Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository named 'chatbot'
   Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Push to GitHub:**
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/chatbot.git
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Voice-enabled AI chatbot with Gemini"
   git push -u origin main

3. **For others to use your project:**
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/chatbot.git
   cd chatbot
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with their own API keys

### 🔑 API Keys Information:
- **Google AI Studio**: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey (for Gemini)
- **Serper API**: https://serper.dev/ (for web search - optional)

Your project is now secure and ready for GitHub! 🎉
